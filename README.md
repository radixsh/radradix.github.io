# Website
This is our first project in AP Computer Science Principles. I'm glad to have had the chance to fiddle with things and actually understand the flow of events between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript in an actual .js file that's actually being used in an actual website is not the same thing as node.js for a Discord bot. 

I would have a "Technologies Used" section, but I think it's fairly obvious that I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I did also use site.js to test it locally (CodeHS was laggy and didn't allow Javascript), as well as GIMP to edit some photos. 

The GitHub site actually does not work. The site is fully set up better on [CodeHS](http://radishhh.codehs.me/). 

## Sources
To create this project, I found the following sources incredibly useful:
* [A Complete Guide to Dark Mode on the Web](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) — I didn't end up using most of this code, but it helped me understand how Javascript can change which CSS files to use based on cookies. 
* [This one Reddit ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/i89yej/how_do_you_create_a_blur_gradienttapering_blur/)
